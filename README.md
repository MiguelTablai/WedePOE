FrostFlow Cold Brew Co.

FrostFlow Cold Brew Co. is a small, independent coffee brand founded in 2020 that specialises in handcrafted cold brew coffee. 
The company partners with local farms and sustainable suppliers to source premium beans, focusing on ethical trade and high quality. While the business currently operates mainly through cafés and retail distributors, it wants an online presence to showcase its full product line and highlight the retailers that stock their products. 
The target audience includes coffee enthusiasts, café owners and goers, and eco-conscious consumers.

•	Building a strong digital identity that reflects FrostFlow’s premium image.

Wireframes will demonstrate a sleek flow from homepage to product details.
