FrostFlow Cold Brew Co.

FrostFlow Cold Brew Co. is a small, independent coffee brand founded in 2020 that specialises in handcrafted cold brew coffee. 
The company partners with local farms and sustainable suppliers to source premium beans, focusing on ethical trade and high quality. While the business currently operates mainly through cafés and retail distributors, it wants an online presence to showcase its full product line and highlight the retailers that stock their products. 
The target audience includes coffee enthusiasts, café owners and goers, and eco-conscious consumers.

•	Displaying a clear directory of retailers and cafés that stock FrostFlow products.

•	Building a strong digital identity that reflects FrostFlow’s premium image.

Features and Functionality

The site will include a homepage, product showcase page, retailer directory, a blog on cold brew tips, and a contact page. The retailer directory will allow customers to quickly find nearby stockists.

Timeline and Milestones

•  Week 1: Branding and wireframe development

•  Week 2–3: Website design and product showcase build

•  Week 4: Retailer directory build

•  Week 5: Testing and SEO optimisation

Design

The design aesthetic will be modern and minimalist, with a blue, white, black and honey gold colour scheme reflecting the sophistication of premium coffee and the cold nature of the product.

Wireframes will demonstrate a sleek flow from homepage to product details.
